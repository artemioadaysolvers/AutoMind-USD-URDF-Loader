BUILD167 · View preset orbit tween + uniform shadow ground
- Iso/Top/Front/Right now use an orbit-style tween from the current camera pose, not a straight cartesian slide or abrupt view jump.
- Show all uses the exact same Iso preset tween as the Iso button.
- Ground & shadows no longer draws a visible square over the grid: ground uses ShadowMaterial so only shadows render.
- Keeps BUILD166 behavior: stable Solid/Wireframe Show all, fast base64 textures, URDF+ loops/joints realtime, clean minimal scripts.
